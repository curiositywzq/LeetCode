# 122.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II——Array,Greedy

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### 思路1(2ms 10.89%)

每两个数之间如果是有得赚的就加起来

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int sum = 0;
        int cur = 0;
        int max = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            cur = prices[i]-prices[i-1];
            if(cur > 0){
                max += cur;
            }
            else{
                sum += max;
                max = 0;
            }
        }
        sum += max;
        return sum;
    }
}
```

一开始想复杂了，实际上下面的就够了

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            if((prices[i] - prices[i-1])>0) sum += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```
