# 503.Next Greater Element II——Stack

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

```

**Note:** The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

### 思路1

对于每一个都遍历一遍，很蠢

### 思路2(45ms 79%)

用一个栈，放index，当栈顶的index对应的数小于接下来的一个，就找到了对应的那个，pop出来

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        int[] res = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(res,-1);
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack();
        for(int i = 0; i < 2 * nums.length; i++){
            int number = nums[i % nums.length];
            while(!stack.isEmpty() && nums[stack.peek()] < number){
                res[stack.pop()] = number;
            }
            if(i < nums.length) stack.push(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
