# 492.Construct the Rectangle

For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

```
1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

```

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

**Example:**

```
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.

```

**Note:**

1. The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
2. The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.

### 思路1(87ms 26%)

开方拿到一个接近的数字，然后一个个试，相当于遍历。这是往大的遍历

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        int l = (int)Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(area));
        int w = l;
        for(int i = l; i <= area; i++){
            if(area % i == 0){
                l = i;
                w = area / l;
                break;
            }
        }
        int[] res = {l,w};
        return res;
    }
}
```

往小的遍历就快了很多(6ms 42%)

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        int w = (int)Math.floor(Math.sqrt(area));
        int l = w;
        for(int i = w; i >= 1; i--){
            if(area % i == 0){
                w = i;
                l = area / w;
                break;
            }
        }
        int[] res = {l,w};
        return res;
    }
}
```
