# 495.Teemo Attacking——Array

In LLP world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking **ascending** time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.

You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,4], 2
Output: 4
Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned immediately. 
This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. 
And at time point 4, Teemo attacks Ashe again, and causes Ashe to be in poisoned status for another 2 seconds. 
So you finally need to output 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2], 2
Output: 3
Explanation: At time point 1, Teemo starts attacking Ashe and makes Ashe be poisoned. 
This poisoned status will last 2 seconds until the end of time point 2. 
However, at the beginning of time point 2, Teemo attacks Ashe again who is already in poisoned status. 
Since the poisoned status won't add up together, though the second poisoning attack will still work at time point 2, it will stop at the end of time point 3. 
So you finally need to output 3.
```

**Note:**

1. You may assume the length of given time series array won't exceed 10000.
2. You may assume the numbers in the Teemo's attacking time series and his poisoning time duration per attacking are non-negative integers, which won't exceed 10,000,000.

### 思路1（11 ms） 

即遍历数组，若数组相邻两数差（两个时间点之间时间差）比duration（每次中毒持续时间）短，那么就加上差，否则加上duration

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        int time = 0;
        if(timeSeries.length < 1) return 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < timeSeries.length-1; i++){
            timeSeries[i] = timeSeries[i+1] - timeSeries[i];
            time += ((timeSeries[i] > duration)?duration:timeSeries[i]);
        }
        time += duration;
        return time;
    }
}
```

下面同一思路，快了一些（10ms）

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        if (timeSeries.length == 0) return 0;
        int begin = timeSeries[0], total = 0;
        for (int t : timeSeries) {
            total+= t < begin + duration ? t - begin : duration;
            begin = t;
        }   
        return total + duration;
    } 
}
```

### 思路2（9ms）

计算出错误时间，比如，[1,2], 2这样的输入的时候，错误的时间是1，即1-2只经过了一个时间，但是duration为2，所以错误时间是1。累计错误时间，最终将其消去，也是一种思路。处理比之前简单了一些。

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] t, int d) {
        if(t==null) return 0;
        if(t.length==1) return d;
        int i=0, err=0;
        while(i<t.length-1){
            if(t[i+1]<t[i]+d)
                err = err + t[i+1] - t[i] - d;
            i++;
        }
        return t.length*d+err;
    }
}
```
